        "a": "To study memory processes",
        "b": "To investigate visual illusions",

      "question": "How did the cues in the experiment affect your response times?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Cues made no difference in my response times.",
        "b": "Response times were faster when the cue was valid (correctly predicted the target location).",
        "c": "Response times were slower when the cue was valid.",
        "d": "I didn't notice any change in response times."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This isn't accurate. The valid cue should have improved response times.",
        "b": "Correct! When the cue was valid, participants responded faster because their attention was directed to the correct location.",
        "c": "This is incorrect. Valid cues should speed up response times, not slow them down.",
        "d": "This suggests a lack of awareness of the cueing effect. Valid cues should have made your response times faster."

    {
      "question": "What did you learn about your attention during the experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "I learned that I am equally fast at responding regardless of where the target appears.",
        "b": "I learned that I respond faster when the cue correctly predicts the target location.",
        "c": "I learned that my attention doesn't shift based on cues.",
        "d": "I didn't notice anything about how my attention works."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is not quite accurate. The experiment should have shown differences in response times based on cue validity.",
        "b": "Correct! When the cue accurately predicted the target location, you likely responded faster due to better-attuned attention.",
        "c": "This is incorrect. The experiment was designed to show how cues affect attention and response times.",
        "d": "This answer suggests that you may not have been aware of the experiment's effects on your attention."
