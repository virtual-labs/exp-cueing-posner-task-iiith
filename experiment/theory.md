## Theory
Attention is a fundamental cognitive process that enables us to selectively focus on specific information while filtering out irrelevant distractions. The Posner task is a classic experimental paradigm used to study attentional cueing effects. It explores how cues and the spatial location of stimuli can influence attention and perception.<br>
The Posner cueing task is a neuropsychological test often used to assess attention. It measures how fast a person can shift their attention from one location to another in the visual field. It also tests how different types of cues (such as arrows or flashes) can affect the attentional shift. It has been used and modified to study various aspects of spatial attention, such as disorders, brain injuries, and development.<br>
In the Posner task, participants are presented with a central fixation point, followed by a cue that provides information about the likely location of a subsequent target stimulus. The cue can be either valid, where it accurately predicts the target's location, or invalid, where it misdirects attention away from the target's location. Participants are then required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to the appearance of the target stimulus.<br>
Researchers classify cues as valid or invalid, and informative or uninformative. Valid cues indicate the location of a relevant stimulus (e.g., a flash where a target will appear); invalid cues do not. Informative cues have a predictable location; uninformative cues do not. In some experiments (like the example below), a cue is valid 75% of the time. Valid cues improve detection performance, especially when they are informative. The more informative the cue, the stronger the effect.<br>
The theory behind the Posner task suggests that valid cues lead to faster reaction times and higher accuracy compared to invalid cues. This is because attention is selectively allocated to the cued location, enhancing perceptual processing and facilitating target detection. In contrast, invalid cues create a conflict between the cue and the target location, resulting in slower reaction times and reduced accuracy.
