## Theory

Attention is a key cognitive process that helps us focus on relevant information while ignoring distractions. The Posner Task is a classic method used to study how visual cues affect attention and perception. It investigates how quickly and accurately people can shift their attention based on different types of cues, such as arrows or flashes.

In this task, participants fixate on a central point before seeing a cue that indicates where a target is likely to appear. The cue can be:

- **Valid**: Correctly predicts the target’s location.
- **Invalid**: Misdirects attention away from the target’s location.

The cue can also be:

- **Informative**: Has a predictable relationship with the target's location.
- **Uninformative**: Provides no reliable information about the target's location.

Participants respond to the target as quickly and accurately as possible. The theory suggests that valid cues improve performance by directing attention to the right location, enhancing perception and reaction time. In contrast, invalid cues slow down responses and reduce accuracy due to conflicting information.

By analyzing reaction times and accuracy rates, researchers can infer how attention is allocated and how cognitive processes operate during visual search tasks. This information is valuable for understanding human behavior, designing user-friendly interfaces, and optimizing task performance in various domains.
