      "question": "Which of the following best describes attentional cuing?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The process of shifting attention from one location to another.",
        "b": "The ability to maintain focus on a single task for an extended period of time.",
        "c": "The automatic capture of attention by a sudden and unexpected stimulus.",
        "d": "The use of cues to direct attention to specific locations in anticipation of a target stimulus."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This describes shifting attention, but it doesn't specify that it's cued by external signals, which is the key idea of attentional cuing.",
        "b": "This describes sustained attention, which is different from attentional cuing, which focuses on shifting attention based on cues.",
        "c": "This describes attentional capture, a different phenomenon where attention is automatically grabbed by a sudden stimulus, not cued in advance.",
        "d": "Correct! Attentional cuing refers to using cues to direct attention to specific locations, preparing the brain for a target stimulus."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",

      "question": "What happens when a valid cue is presented in the Posner task?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It misdirects attention, slowing down reaction time.",
        "b": "It helps focus attention on the correct location, speeding up response time.",
        "c": "It causes confusion and makes it harder to detect the target.",
        "d": "It has no effect on the reaction time or accuracy."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This describes an invalid cue, which misdirects attention and slows response times.",
        "b": "Correct! A valid cue helps focus attention on the target's location, making it easier and faster to detect the target.",
        "c": "This would happen with an invalid cue, which creates conflict and delays response time.",
        "d": "This is not true. Valid cues actually improve performance by directing attention to the correct location."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the Posner task, what is the purpose of using cues before the target appears?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To distract the participant and make the task harder.",
        "b": "To test if the participant can ignore distractions.",
        "c": "To help the participant focus attention on the likely location of the target.",
        "d": "To confuse the participant into making a wrong guess."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cues are not meant to distract but to guide attention. The goal is to improve task performance, not make it harder.",
        "b": "While the task does require attention, the goal of cues is not to test the ability to ignore distractions.",
        "c": "Correct! The cues are used to direct the participant's attention to the likely location of the target to improve detection.",
        "d": "This is not the purpose of the cueing task. Cues are meant to guide attention, not confuse the participant."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
