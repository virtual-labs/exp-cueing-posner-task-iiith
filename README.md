### About the Experiment 
The aim of this experiment is to investigate attentional cuing using the Posner task, which explores how attention is directed to specific locations and how it influences perception. By investigating the psychological processes behind attentional shifts using cues, the task highlights how users interact with their environment and make decisions based on visual information. This understanding is crucial for designing intuitive systems, user interfaces, and environments that align with human attentional capabilities.
